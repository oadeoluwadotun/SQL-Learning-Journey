Derived Columns and arithmetic operators
Creating a new column that is a combination of existing columns is known as a
derived column (or "calculated" or "computed" column). Usually you want to give
a name, or "alias," to your new column using the AS keyword.

This derived column, and its alias, are generally only temporary, existing just
for the duration of your query. The next time you run a query and access this
table, the new column will not be there.

If you are deriving the new column from existing columns using a mathematical
expression, then these familiar mathematical operators will be useful:

* (Multiplication)
+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
/ (Division)
Consider this example:

SELECT id, (standard_amt_usd/total_amt_usd)*100 AS std_percent, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;
Here we divide the standard paper dollar amount by the total order amount to
find the standard paper percent for the order, and use the AS keyword to name
this new column "std_percent." You can run this query on the next page if you'd
like, to see the output'.

Order of Operations
Remember PEMDAS from math class to help remember the order of operations?
The same order of operations applies when using arithmetic operators in SQL.

The following two statements have very different end results:

Standard_qty / standard_qty + gloss_qty + poster_qty
standard_qty / (standard_qty + gloss_qty + poster_qty)

It is likely that you mean to do the calculation as written in statement number 2!

Questions using Arithmetic Operations
Using the orders table:

Create a column that divides the standard_amt_usd by the standard_qty to find
the unit price for standard paper for each order. Limit the results to the first
10 orders, and include the id and account_id fields.
Answer:
SELECT id, account_id, standard_amt_usd/standard_qty AS unit_price
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;

Write a query that finds the percentage of revenue that comes from poster paper
for each order. You will need to use only the columns that end with _usd.
(Try to do this without using the total column.) Display the id and account_id
fields also. NOTE - you will receive an error with the correct solution to this
question. This occurs because at least one of the values in the data creates a
division by zero in your formula. You will learn later in the course how to
fully handle this issue. For now, you can just limit your calculations to the
first 10 orders, as we did in question #1, and you will avoid that set of data
that causes the problem.
Answer:
SELECT id, account_id, poster_amt_usd/(gloss_amt_usd + poster_amt_usd + standard_amt_usd) *100 AS poster_percent
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;
